# Neovim Configuration
This is my configuration for neovim. Still a work in progress, nowhere near what I want it to be.

I'm not sure if I'll stick with neovim, but we'll see.

lua/myrrh/core has all general keybindings and options. Plugins have individual plugins.

Using lazy.nvim for installing plugins.
